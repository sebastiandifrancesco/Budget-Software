# Budget-Software
# This software reads my personal budget from a .txt file called "Budget.txt". My personal budget is broken down into the following subcategories: checking account and savings account. Under the checking account, my personal budget is further broken down into the following subcategories: my wants (that I am saving), my other wants (that I can spend now), and my needs. Under the savings account, my personal budget is further broken down into the following subcategories: taxes and savings. When the software is run it asks the user "What would you like to do". The options include A: record expense, B: record income, C: make a direct change, F: show me where my money is, and G: quit. Options D and E are there for a future project's sake. When I choose the record income option it then asks me for an amount. After that it splits that amount accordingly between all my different subcategories of my personal budget. 11.5% is taken out and added to my taxes subcategory. Then 15% of the remaining amount goes into each wants subcategory (30% total), 20% goes into my savings subcategory, and the remaining 50% goes into my needs subcategory. Options A and B allow me to modify the different subcategory amounts according to how my money changes in real life. Option F displays to the user the totals of each of my personal budgeting subcategories. This software is intended to be used by people who want to make their budgeting easier.
